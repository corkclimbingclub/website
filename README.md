# Cork climbing club

This project has been setup with [Astro](https://astro.build/)

To deploy you need to :

1. Run `npm install`
2. Build the website using `npm run build`
3. Push the new dist directory to the server using (replace `$VERSION` by your version, for example `v0.1`) : `scp -sr dist corkclt@ftp.cluster023.hosting.ovh.net:/home/corkclt/dist-$VERSION`

NB : You will be prompted for a password. This corresponds to the "corkclt" SFTP user password in OVH (if you don't have the password, you will have to change it [here](https://www.ovh.com/manager/#/web/hosting/corkclt.cluster023.hosting.ovh.net/ftp))

4. Go on the [OVH project page](https://www.ovh.com/manager/#/web/hosting/corkclt.cluster023.hosting.ovh.net/multisite) and change the root folder of the "corkclimbingclub.ie" and "www.corkclimbingclub.ie" to your new dist folder

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
