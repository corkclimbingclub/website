  "description": "<p>This trip is only open to experienced & intermediate Trad climbers (intermediate are those that own gear but only climb occasionally) </br> If you wish to attend, experience climbing cracks would be ideal but not 100% necessary. </br> Bouldering is also an option but you would need a number of pads due to the terrain. If you which to do both the above applies. </br> Accommodation: Camping in McBrideâ€™s  farm - basically wild camping as there is only cold water and a Portaloo, no kitchen facilities.</p>"
