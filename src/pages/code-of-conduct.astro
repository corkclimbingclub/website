        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          Cork Climbing Club is committed to providing a welcoming, safe, and inclusive environment for all members and participants. We believe that climbing is for everyone, regardless of background, experience level, gender, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, or physical ability. Our community thrives when we treat each other with respect, kindness, and consideration.

        <h2>Respect and Inclusivity</h2>
        <p>
            We are an inclusive club and expect all members to treat each other with courtesy and respect, regardless of their experience level, background, or personal characteristics. We promote a positive environment, welcoming people of all ages, genders, races, religions, sexual orientations, and abilities. Sexist, racist, ageist, harassment, bullying or other discriminatory behaviour in words or actions is not tolerated. Any behaviour that marginalises, intimidates, or excludes others is unacceptable. 
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Safety and Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
            Rock climbing and mountaineering are activities that can be dangerous and may result in personal injury or death. Participants should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions and involvement. Participation in club activities is not an automatic right and can be restricted by the committee based on relevant skill, experience, health or other mitigating factors. Members must abide by any guidelines that may be set out by the club in accordance with Mountaineering Irelandâ€™s advice and policies. 
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Alcohol and Substance Use</h2>
        <p>
            All club members, leaders and volunteers as part of this club shall follow the law when it comes to illegal drugs, alcohol and tobacco and shall display leadership and good example. Club members, leaders or volunteers shall not present themselves at club walks or climbs while under the influence of alcohol or any other illegal/non-prescription drug. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
            Maintain open and honest communication with club members and leaders. Share any concerns, issues, or feedback constructively. All communication of an official nature within the club and between its members must be done in a recorded medium such as emails or over a club forum. If a member has concerns, they should raise the matter with a member of the committee. Members should aim to actively participate in club activities and meetings, share knowledge and skills with others, fostering a supportive learning environment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Handling Conflicts</h2>
        <p>
            Members should address conflicts or grievances respectfully and through appropriate channels, following the club's complaints procedure if necessary.
        </p>
      </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Respect for the Environment and Local Communities</h2>
            <p>
                Access to the outdoors is fundamental to the activities of hillwalking and climbing. Much of our activity takes place on privately-owned land, due to the goodwill and tolerance of landowners. Club members are asked to recognise that each one of us shares in the responsibility to protect access by helping to maintain positive relations with landowners and the local community in the areas where we walk and climb. Many activities take place in sensitive natural environments, and it's important to minimise environmental impact. Members should keep within existing path lines where possible, avoid leaving litter, and follow any specific guidelines provided by the club or for the areas visited.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Social Media and Public Representation</h2>
            <p>
                Be mindful of the content shared on social media, ensuring it reflects positively on the club and respects the privacy of members. Members should obtain permission before sharing photos or videos of members, especially in public forums.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Committee Members</h2>
            <p>
                Committee members are democratically elected members who accept their role within the committee structure to do the best possible job based upon the role description presented under their title. Committee members must be willing to operate in an impartial and transparent manner, always putting the best interest of the club first. Committee members must be adequately accessible to members of the club and must attend the relevant club activities to be able to perform their duties properly.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Gear, Equipment and Facilities</h2>
            <p>
                All members are expected to use appropriate gear and equipment for their activity. It is the sole responsibility of each individual to make sure their personal equipment and gear is safe for use and maintained correctly.
