        <h2>Got questions about climbing?</h2>
        <p>Our community is not just made up of climbers, it’s made up of professionals from all walks of life who choose climbing as their hobby. And, like many climbers, we spend a lot of time outdoors and care deeply about the natural world around us. 
          So if you have questions about climbing, geology, conservation, fitness, or anything else you think we could assist with, feel free to reach out. We may just have the answers for you!</p>
